# Brick Breaker Simple Code

A code (old one and ugly but it runs!!!!) made from scratch and using canvas (yes canvas). Is it useful? I don't think so, 
but it's funny.

Searching for game engines or frameworks:

1. Unity
2. UDK
3. Cocos2d-x
4. More

This is a simple demonstration using the following:

1. SurfaceView (Canvas)
2. Old SoundPool that is deprecated (it's going to be updated, please check the TODO at the end of this readme)
3. Accelerometer
4. Threading

Here you can see a preview tested on One Plus 7 Pro:

Also here is a video with the mini game running:

TODO:
1. Update deprecated code.
2. Add lifecycle arch to manage correctly the code.
3. Clean the code just for demons.
4. To add more but right now without ideas.
